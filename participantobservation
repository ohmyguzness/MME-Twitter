Participant Observation

I have used twitter for the past four years

I have found the user base to be very pessimistic & self deprecating
For example:

  - the famous account [so sad today](https://twitter.com/sosadtoday?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
  - there are a lot of sad tweets that post relatable content

  ![sadtweet2](sadtweet2.png)
  ![sadtweet3](sadtweet3.png)

    I feel that because of twitter's relaxed policy and microblogging like platform people lean towards posting more content aimed at expressing their emotions rather than other social media sites that give an idealized view of people's lives

  - Accounts not made for personal use usually have a consistent theme described in their usernames where they post repetitive content
  - Twitter is also notoriously used for "throwing shade" or as users call it "indirects"
      - it is when users will insult or say degrading things about a person they dislike without directly saying the person's name
      - I believe that this is the most prevalent form of bullying on the platform, & that oddly enough I am way more scared of facebook comments than twitter replies (mostly because people's main goals seem to be just making a pun or joke to get the most favorites or retweets)

- Twitter has also kept me updated in real time. I learned about carrie fisher's hospitalization/death via twitter and a lot of other celebrity news. This is probably due to the large celebrity user base. Twitter has loosened the restrictions on who is able to be verified from when that aspect was introduced to the platform. I have used Twitter to keep track on when some of my favorite musicians release music.
