- The Internet of Ownership organization launched a campaign to turn twitter into a cooperative owned by its users.
- The petition has about 1,500 signatures so far
- The campaign started with journalist and author Nathan Schneider
- Assemble a company and invite investment for shares that grant dividend rights, but not voting; gather about 20 percent of the funds needed for the buyout, then borrow the rest, and buy. As for the voting rights, they’d be distributed according to a “ladder of engagement,” including investors and general users, but allocating more control to those who contribute the most value to the platform, such as employees and the most active users.  Finally, there could be a few “golden shares” with veto rights, perhaps controlled by a foundation representing all users
- Schneider could also see the U.S. government stepping in to recognize Twitter as a public utility — an idea that New York Times Reporter Farhad Manjoo has also floated.

- a plea from "The people who love Twitter most love it not because of what they can get from selling it but for what we all create on it together"
-"The buyer of you, in certain ways, is the buyer of us"
- wants to change business model to favor the users rather than take advantage of them

- Twitter sits cozily at the 9th spot in terms of users and an ever-dwindling valuation. Twitter is currently valued at US$ 15 billion, less than its valuation of US$ 18 billion at the time of its IPO
- To incentivize video makers, Twitter shares revenue with them, where the creators get 70% of the cut and the rest is kept by Twitter. This is better than the 55% cut offered by YouTube to content creators. Twitter, with the help of Periscope, has been trying to bring live-streaming into the foray. It bought the digital rights of NFL in the US for US$ 10 million in 2016. It wants to get exclusive digital rights to big events like NFL games, political debates, award ceremonies etc to enhance its business model
