- The petition has about 1,500 signatures so far
- The campaign started with journalist and author Nathan Schneider
- Assemble a company and invite investment for shares that grant dividend rights, but not voting; gather about 20 percent of the funds needed for the buyout, then borrow the rest, and buy. As for the voting rights, they’d be distributed according to a “ladder of engagement,” including investors and general users, but allocating more control to those who contribute the most value to the platform, such as employees and the most active users.  Finally, there could be a few “golden shares” with veto rights, perhaps controlled by a foundation representing all users
- Schneider could also see the U.S. government stepping in to recognize Twitter as a public utility — an idea that New York Times Reporter Farhad Manjoo has also floated.
