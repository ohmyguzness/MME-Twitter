- Twitter bots are, essentially, computer programs that tweet of their own accord
- made possible by Twitter’s wide-open application programming interface, or A.P.I.
    - Twitter’s API allows you to access certain points of a public profile. As a basic use of the API, you could write a program where you can search for someone’s username and it’ll return the profile page. Instead of walking up to the Twitter office every time you have a request, the API gives access to the program to return the profile page

- A darker perspective on twitter bots
- The bots that Ferrara have observed over the years are almost always used for malicious purposes. They manipulate political campaigns, they influence the stock market, they spread conspiracies, they deny science; “all sorts of bad things,” he says
-  he published a study covered here on Co.Design showing that 20% of all political tweets during the televised presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were made by bots. Today, automated Twitter users are still influencing the conversation around everything from the healthcare debate to the NFL’s #TakeAKnee controversy
