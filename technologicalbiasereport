Technological Bias Report

Twitter is as Tim Cook says, "The ultimate megaphone". It enables people to voice their thoughts and opinions to large audiences instantly. There initially was a blatant bias towards those who were visually impaired, especially with the photo sharing content. They fixed this eventually with the addition of [embedded photo descriptions](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/picture-descriptions). "When you Tweet photos using the Twitter app for iOS or Android, or on twitter.com, you have the option to compose a description of the images so the content is accessible to people who are visually impaired." Digging deeper than just physical disabilities, I then found that Twitter feels more biased towards to the extroverted. Having used Twitter for over 4 years, I found that majority of the content on my account is not even mine, mostly just stuff I have retweeted. I found that I have a very limited amount of personal statements tweeted because I am just not very vocal about my personal issues and also I just have a fear of being too open on the internet. This said, the platform is built to reward those who enjoy sharing/complaining/talking. I am less inclined to voice my woes and I hate to admit, but I am also fearful of the like feature. The like feature counts how many people agree with what you have said and the nature of Twitter means it rewards those who can appease a large audience. Those with views that differ public opinion do not get an equal exposure as their content is less likely to be shared with the public.
