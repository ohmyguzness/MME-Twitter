Twitter has always had a reputation of being the most shallow of all the other social media platforms. It potentially gives voice to quite a range, from the angriest of opinions to the most powerful of protests. Personally, as a Twitter user I have stayed due to the honestly of what people say. While I would not rely on Twitter as a sole news platform, I enjoy getting information from first hand accounts and piece together the situation rather than have a news station edit my perspective. When I was showed Marshall Mcluhan's statement, "the medium is the message", I agreed that it fit social media perfectly. Twitter has single handedly evolved the way people are now consuming their news. Older generations fear that younger generations have grown apathetic to politics, but Twitter somewhat begs to differ. Yes, I understand that Twitter is full of false information, but that is the internet in general. From my personal experience, I have found Twitter to bring issues to light that fly under traditional media's radar. Naturally, people use Twitter to say what is on their mind, and those who are passionate for just causes do in fact get light on their beliefs. I wouldn't say I have found myself thoroughly informed, but definitely more aware of what is going on in the world (and not just what is happening in America!). Also from my perspective and research, I have found Twitter to be honest in the sense that it is the only social media platform where people talk about the bad. What I mean by that is unlike Instagram or Facebook, people on Twitter post not just happy life moments, but the daily grind. Twitter is meant to act like a personal blog, and with that comes the not so amazing days. Complaints are quickly typed off and sent with the click of a button. There is no need to edit or put a filter, and this quick format allows for a more candid and true sense of users.
